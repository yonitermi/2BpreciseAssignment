# Critical Tests :

1 - Test for successful retrieval: Send a GET request to the /allele endpoint and verify that the response status code is 200 (OK) and the response body contains the expected allele information.
2 - Test for invalid endpoint: Send a GET request to a non-existent endpoint (e.g., /alleles) and verify that the response status code is 404 (Not Found), indicating that the endpoint does not exist.
3 - Test for authentication: Send a GET request to the /allele endpoint without providing valid authentication credentials and verify that the response status code is 401 (Unauthorized), indicating that authentication is required.
5 - Test for parameter validation: Send a GET request to the /allele endpoint with invalid or missing parameters, such as an invalid allele ID or missing required query parameters, and verify that the response status code is 400 (Bad Request) and the response body provides meaningful error messages.
5 - Test for response format: Send a GET request to the /allele endpoint and verify that the response body is in the expected format, such as JSON or XML, and adheres to the defined data model.

# Additional Tests:

1 - Performance test: Send a series of GET requests to the /allele endpoint with a large number of concurrent users or high request rates to evaluate the system's performance and ensure it can handle the expected load.
2 - Test for rate limiting: Send a sequence of GET requests to the /allele endpoint exceeding the rate limit and verify that the response status code is 429 (Too Many Requests), indicating that the API has reached its limit for incoming requests.
3 - Test for filtering and sorting: Send GET requests to the /allele endpoint with different filter and sort parameters (e.g., filter by gene, variant, or source) and verify that the response returns the expected subset of allele information and the sorting is done correctly.
4 - Test for pagination: Send GET requests to the /allele endpoint with different page and page size parameters to test the pagination functionality and verify that the response includes the correct subset of allele information based on the specified page and page size.
5 - Test for data integrity: Perform a data validation check by comparing the allele information obtained from the API with a trusted data source to ensure consistency and accuracy. This can involve cross-referencing allele details, such as gene names, variant IDs, or allele frequencies, with known references or external databases.
